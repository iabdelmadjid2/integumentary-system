                        <h3>üõ°Ô∏è Protection</h3>
                        <p>The skin acts as a strong barrier to keep out harmful microbes, chemicals, and physical damage. Its outermost layer of dead, keratinized cells forms a tough shield. Hair adds extra protection against UV rays and helps reduce injury, while nails protect delicate fingertips and toes from impact and damage. The skin's immune cells also recognize and fight invading pathogens, making it a frontline defender against infection.</p>

                    <div class="function-card">
                        <h3>üëã Sensation</h3>
                        <p>The skin contains millions of nerve endings that detect pain, pressure, temperature, and touch. This sensory network allows us to respond quickly to danger, avoid injury, and experience pleasure or discomfort. Specialized receptors like Merkel cells detect light touch and texture, while free nerve endings sense temperature changes and pain.</p>

                        <h3>üå°Ô∏è Temperature Regulation</h3>
                        <p>Sweat glands release sweat, which evaporates from the skin surface to cool the body. Blood vessels in the dermis widen (vasodilation) to increase heat loss when hot or narrow (vasoconstriction) to conserve heat when cold. This dynamic system helps maintain a stable internal temperature despite changing environments.</p>

                        <h3>‚òÄÔ∏è Vitamin D Synthesis</h3>
                        <p>When skin is exposed to sunlight, UV rays convert a molecule called 7-dehydrocholesterol in the epidermis into vitamin D3. This vitamin is vital for calcium absorption, supporting strong bones and healthy muscle and nerve function. Without enough sun exposure, vitamin D deficiency can occur, affecting overall health.</p>

                        <h3>üö∞ Excretion and Waste Removal</h3>
                        <p>Sweat produced by eccrine glands contains water, salts, and small amounts of metabolic wastes like urea and lactic acid. Sweating helps remove these substances and also assists in regulating electrolyte balance. This subtle excretion complements the work of kidneys in maintaining body chemistry.</p>

                        <h3>üíß Water Balance</h3>
                        <p>The skin's waterproof barrier prevents excessive water loss while allowing controlled release through perspiration. This critical function helps maintain proper hydration levels and prevents dehydration, especially in challenging environmental conditions.</p>
